To do the assignment you need to have in your system:

- [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) or above (Node 12.17.0 at the time of writing)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

This README assumes you have these dependencies already. If you need instructions to install them they should be available in their respective websites.

## Development

You can fork or clone this repository to start working and use `yarn` to install the JS dependencies.

    $ git clone https://github.com/bahkostya/web-worker-sorting.git
    $ cd web-worker-sorting

To start the development server, open a terminal and run:

Go to http://localhost:10001. You need to keep this terminal window running for the development server to work.
